retrosheet-download-dotnet
==========================

This is a .NET console app to download and parse Retrosheet event files. You should be able to just run the executable and go. The app will download all the regular season event files for all years available dating back to 1921. Everything will be downloaded, extracted, and parsed in C:\retrosheet. You will need to make sure the BEVENT application is located in that directory.

Here's a notice regarding use of Retrosheet data:
